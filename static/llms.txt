# 1claw

> 1claw is a cloud-hosted Hardware Security Module (HSM) secrets manager that lets humans grant AI agents scoped, audited, revocable access to secrets — without ever exposing raw credentials to the agent.

## What 1claw does

1claw stores API keys, tokens, and other secrets inside a cloud HSM. Humans control which agents can access which secrets, with what permissions, and for how long. Agents authenticate with 1claw and receive secrets at runtime — they never hold secrets in their own environment or context window.

## Two APIs

- **Human API** — Used by the secret owner (a person or team). Create/manage vaults and secrets, register agents, create policies (grants), set permissions, view audit logs, rotate credentials, monitor billing.
- **Agent API** — Same REST base URL; agents authenticate with an agent token (JWT from API key). Fetch authorized secrets by path, list accessible secrets, same audit surface.

## MCP Server

1claw provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI agents (Claude, Cursor, GPT) just-in-time access to vault secrets.

- **Hosted** at `mcp.1claw.xyz` — no installation needed; authenticate with `Authorization` and `X-Vault-ID` headers.
- **Local (stdio)** — run via Claude Desktop or Cursor with agent token and vault ID as env vars.
- **7 tools**: `list_secrets`, `get_secret`, `put_secret`, `delete_secret`, `describe_secret`, `rotate_and_store`, `get_env_bundle`.
- **Resource**: `vault://secrets` — browsable listing of all secret paths.
- Secrets are fetched just-in-time, never cached, never logged.

## Billing & Usage

- **Free tier**: 1,000 API requests/month per organization.
- **Pay-per-use**: x402 micropayments on Base (EIP-155:8453) after free tier.
- **Pricing**: Read secret $0.001, write $0.005, share $0.002, audit $0.0005.
- Usage is tracked across dashboard, SDK, and MCP — all count against the same quota.

## Core concepts

- **Vault** — A container for secrets; each vault has its own HSM-backed key (KEK). You create vaults, then store secrets inside them.
- **Secret** — An encrypted credential stored in the vault (API key, token, password, certificate, etc.) at a path (e.g. `passwords/one`, `api-keys/stripe`).
- **Agent** — A registered AI entity (Claude, GPT, custom bot, MCP server) that receives an API key and can be granted access via policies.
- **Policy (grant)** — Links a principal (user or agent) to secret path patterns with permissions (read, write, delete, etc.) and optional conditions/expiry.
- **HSM** — Hardware Security Module; in production 1claw uses Google Cloud KMS. DEKs wrap secrets; KEKs wrap DEKs and never leave the HSM.
- **Human auth** — Email/password or Google OAuth → JWT. Personal API keys (`1ck_`) also get a JWT.
- **Agent auth** — Agent API key (`ocv_`) exchanged for a short-lived JWT via `POST /v1/auth/agent-token`.
